Parts to do:

1) Explanatory data analysis to see the relationship between the prices and categories: like “prices” vs “area of housing” - can be scatter plots, heatmaps, etc. 
2) Data preprocessing:
  - Cleaning the NAN, null, missing values
  - Handling Text and Categorical Attributes (like ocean proximity)
  - Feature scaling - normalization
  - Creating new parameters out of existing? (total_bedrooms/total_rooms)

3) Modelling:
  - Linear Regression - baseline
  - Random Forest
  - Lasso
  - Elastic Net
  - Support Vector Machine?
  - Gaussian Processes (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html))

4) Models optimization (hyperparameters tuning)
5) Basic error analysis using cross validation (mean squared error)
6) Feature extraction/importance (Can experiment with different categories (features, columns) combinations for the models)
